# Classification Prediction on Iris Dataset using Machine Learning



## Project Description
Building the best model to classify the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics through several machine learning prediction techniques is the primary focuses from this project. The dataset that I used consisting of 150 samples representing three species of Iris flowers includes four features. The dataset can be found in various repositories, including from the scikit-learn library in this [link](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris). 


### Project Goals
1. **Develop several classification model to predict the species of an Iris flower**

2. **Evaluate all models by comparing their accuracy to get the best model**

3. **Understanding the relationships between features and their impact on model accuracy**


### Methodology
1. **Load Data form [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris) library**

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

3. **Data Pre-processing**

4. **Data visualization**

5. **Splitting and Scaling Data**

6. **Modelling: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Decision Tree**

7. **Conclusion**



### Project Key Insights
1. **The Petal Length and Petal Width features are highly discriminative for separating the three species**

2. **Visualizing the dataset using pair plot and heatmap can reveal clear boundaries between the species, especially for setosa**

3. **SVM model with 96,67% accuracy point is chosen as the best model because it has better generalization ability and resistance to overfitting, making it more stable and reliable for new data**
